                        &emsp; Hy babe, I am truly sorry for not being able to tell you this in person. Iâ€™ve been trying to find the right words, but every time I see you, my mind goes blank. So, I decided to write this letter instead. I hope it conveys what I feel in my heart.
                    <br> <br>
                    <span>
                        &emsp;  I am truly sorry for my actions and the hurt I caused you, sorry for being the way I am sometimes, I'm sorry for my overthinking, sorry for not treating you the best sometimes. I'm sorry, I make mistakes, but i love you so much and i don't wanna lose you. I hope you know that i love you and I appreciate everything you do for me. I never meant to make you feel this way, and I deeply regret my mistakes. I want you to know that I take full responsibility for my mistakes and I am committed to making things right between us. I will continue to work on myself and be a better person for you, because you deserve the best. I'll be better for you, I'll love you harder, I'll be more patient, I'll be more understanding, I'll put in more effort, I'll treat you better, I'll be more gentle, I'll listen more, I'll be a better man for you. I want to be the person you deserve, and I will do everything in my power to make that happen. I am ready to say sorry a million times if it means making things right between us. I want to be the person you can rely on, the person who makes you happy, and the person who loves you unconditionally, you are such a blessing in my life, and I am grateful for every moment we share together. I cherish the memories we have created, and I look forward to making many more in the future. You are my everything, and I will always love you with all my heart.
